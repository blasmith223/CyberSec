### Supplementary Lesson Plans:

In the event that you have an issue with Azure Lab Services and are not able to access lab environments, you can use the following [supplemental lesson plans](1-Lesson-Plans/XX-Supplemental-LPs) as alternatives to the scheduled class. 

These lesson plans all require that you use [version 1.2 or later](https://app.vagrantup.com/cybersecurity/boxes/UbuntuVM/versions/1.2.3) of the Vagrant virtual machine. 

These lesson plans are designed to minimize preparation time. 

- The Git, Networking and Command Line CTF lesson plans are activity-based. Students will work on a single large activity throughout the day. If you are unfamiliar with Git, you may need to do some additional prep to familiarize yourself with the topic for the Git CTF. 

- The Web Vulnerabilities lesson plan is a series of review activities. Prep time should be minimal since the concepts were previously covered in Unit 15.  

- The Container Security lesson plan contains new content that will require some preparation. If you have a background in Cloud or DevSecOps, preparation should be minimal. 

- The Python lessons are brand new content. However, the activities are fairly straightforward and do not require heavy infrastructure.

Depending on where your class is in the course, you can use the following lesson plans: 

- [Git CTF](1-Lesson-Plans/XX-Supplemental-LPs/Git-CTF) can be completed anytime after Unit 3. 

- [Python Basics](1-Lesson-Plans/XX-Supplemental-LPs/Python) can be completed anytime after Unit 3. 

- [Command Line CTF](1-Lesson-Plans/XX-Supplemental-LPs/cmd-CTF) can be completed anytime after Unit 6. 

- [Network CTF](1-Lesson-Plans/XX-Supplemental-LPs/Networking-CTF) can be completed anytime after Unit 9.  

- [Web Vulnerabilities Review](1-Lesson-Plans/XX-Supplemental-LPs/Web-Vulns-Review) can be completed anytime after Unit 15. 

- [Container Security](1-Lesson-Plans/XX-Supplemental-LPs/Container-Security) can be completed anytime after Unit 15.
