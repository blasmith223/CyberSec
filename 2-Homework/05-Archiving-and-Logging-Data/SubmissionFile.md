### Step 1: Create, Extract, Compress, and Manage tar Backup Archives

1. Command to **extract** the `TarDocs.tar` archive to the current directory: tar -xf TarDocs.tar.gz

2. Command to **create** the `Javaless_Doc.tar` archive from the `TarDocs/` directory, while excluding the `TarDocs/Documents/Java` directory: tar cvvf Javaless_Docs.tar --exclude "/*Java" ~/Projects/TarDocs/Documents/


3. Command to ensure `Java/` is not in the new `Javaless_Docs.tar` archive: tar tvvf Javaless_Docs.tar | grep -R "Java"

**Bonus** 
- Command to create an incremental archive called `logs_backup_tar.gz` with only changed files to `snapshot.file` for the `/var/log` directory: tar cvvWf logs_backup.tar.gz --listed-incremental=logs_backup.snar --level=0 /var/log

#### Critical Analysis Question

- Why wouldn't you use the options `-x` and `-c` at the same time with `tar`? 

Because the -c operation writes a new archive, and the -x opertions extracts data you shouldn't do these while you are backingup data.

### Step 2: Create, Manage, and Automate Cron Jobs

1. Cron job for backing up the `/var/log/auth.log` file: 0 18 * * 3 tar cvvf auth_backup.tgz /var/log/auth.log >/dev/null 2>&1


---

### Step 3: Write Basic Bash Scripts

1. Brace expansion command to create the four subdirectories: mkdir -p backups/{freemem,diskuse,openkist,freedisk}


2. Paste your `system.sh` script edits below:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

free -h>~/backups/freemem/free_mem.txt
du -h>~/backups/diskuse/disk_usage.txt
lsof >~/backups/openkist/open_list.txt
df -h>~/backups/freedisk/free_disk.txt

    

3. Command to make the `system.sh` script executable: chmod u+x system.sh

**Optional**
- Commands to test the script and confirm its execution: sudo ./system.sh

**Bonus**
- Command to copy `system` to system-wide cron directory:
sudo crontab -e

0 0 * * 0 bash ~/system.sh

---

### Step 4. Manage Log File Sizes
 
1. Run `sudo nano /etc/logrotate.conf` to edit the `logrotate` configuration file. 

    Configure a log rotation scheme that backs up authentication messages to the `/var/log/auth.log`.

    - Add your config file edits below:
# see "man logrotate" for details
# rotate log files weekly
weekly

# use the syslog group by default, since this is the owning group
# of /var/log/syslog.
su root syslog

# keep 4 weeks worth of backlogs
rotate 7

# create new (empty) log files after rotating old ones
create

# Do not rotate empty logs
notifempty

# uncomment this if you want your log files compressed
delaycompress

# packages drop log rotation information into this directory
include /etc/logrotate.d

# no packages own wtmp, or btmp -- we'll rotate them here
/var/log/wtmp {
    missingok
    monthly
    create 0664 root utmp
    rotate 1
}

/var/log/btmp {
    missingok
    monthly
    create 0660 root utmp
    rotate 1
}


    ```

### Bonus: Check for Policy and File Violations

1. Command to verify `auditd` is active: systemctl status auditd

2. Command to set number of retained logs and maximum log file size: sudo nano /etc/audit/auditd.conf

    - Add the edits made to the configuration file below: 
    # This file controls the configuration of the audit daemon
#

local_events = yes
write_logs = yes
log_file = /var/log/audit/audit.log
log_group = adm
log_format = RAW
flush = INCREMENTAL_ASYNC
freq = 50
max_log_file = 35
num_logs = 7
priority_boost = 4
disp_qos = lossy
dispatcher = /sbin/audispd
name_format = NONE
##name = mydomain
max_log_file_action = ROTATE
space_left = 75
space_left_action = SYSLOG
verify_email = yes
action_mail_acct = root
admin_space_left = 50
admin_space_left_action = SUSPEND
disk_full_action = SUSPEND
disk_error_action = SUSPEND
use_libwrap = yes
##tcp_listen_port = 60


    ```bash
    [Your solution edits here]
    ```

3. Command using `auditd` to set rules for `/etc/shadow`, `/etc/passwd` and `/var/log/auth.log`: 

sudo nano /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules


    - Add the edits made to the `rules` file below:
    -w /etc/shadow -p wra -k shadow
    -w /etc/passwd -p wra -k passwd
    -w /var/log/auth.log -p wra 

    ```bash
    [Your solution edits here]
    ```

4. Command to restart `auditd`: sudo systemctl restart auditd

5. Command to list all `auditd` rules: sudo auditctl -l

6. Command to produce an audit report: sudo aureport

7. Create a user with `sudo useradd attacker` and produce an audit report that lists account modifications: 
    sudo aureport -m

8. Command to use `auditd` to watch `/var/log/cron`: sudo auditctl -w /var/log/cron

9. Command to verify `auditd` rules: sudo auditctl -l

### Bonus (Research Activity): Perform Various Log Filtering Techniques

1. Command to return `journalctl` messages with priorities from emergency to error: journalctl -b -1  -p "emerg".."crit"

1. Command to check the disk usage of the system journal unit since the most recent boot: journalctl --disk-usage

1. Comand to remove all archived journal files except the most recent two: sudo journalctl --rotate


1. Command to filter all log messages with priority levels between zero and two, and save output to `/home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt`:journalctl -b -1  -p "emerg".."crit" | > /home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt

1. Command to automate the last command in a daily cronjob. Add the edits made to the crontab file below: 

    0 0 * * * journalctl -b -1  -p "emerg".."crit" | > /home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt
